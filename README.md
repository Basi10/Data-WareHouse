# Scalable DataWarehouse

## Objectives
After joining an AI startup that deploys sensors to businesses, collects data from all activities
in a business - peopleâ€™s interaction, traffic flows, smart appliances installed in a company, the
objective is to help organisations obtain critical intelligence based on public and private data
they collect and organise.


## Data
The [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data) used for this project is from open source dataset called PNeuma which is an open large-scale dataset of naturalistic trajectories of half a million vehicles that have been collected by a one-of-a-kind experiment by a swarm of drones in the congested downtown area of Athens, Greece. 


## Requirements
The project requires the following:
python3
Pip3
